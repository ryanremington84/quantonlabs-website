## To Deploy

1. Upload `index.html` to your web server
2. Upload `styles.css` to the same directory
3. Upload `script.js` to the same directory
4. Upload all 5 logo files to the same directory
5. That's it - the site will work immediately

## What's Preserved

All your existing features remain intact:
- Animated background orbs
- Electrical grid pattern
- Header hide/show on scroll
- Flip card animations (hover to reveal)
- Stats section with electrical pulse effect
- Component cards with pulse animation
- Smooth scrolling
- Full responsive design
- All hover effects and transitions

## Logo File Usage

- **Header:** Uses animated SVG (shows AI agent architecture)
- **Footer:** Uses static light PNG (better for dark background)
- **Marketing:** Use primary or reverse PNG files as needed
- **Social Media:** Use static or static-light depending on background

## File Notes

The logo PNGs are actually JPEG format with .png extension - this is fine and doesn't affect display or quality. They will load and display correctly in all browsers.
